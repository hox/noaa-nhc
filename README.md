# ðŸŒ´ NHC Atlantic Outlook Discord Webhook

When the National Hurricane Center posts a new [hurricane / tropical weather outlook](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/), a notification will be sent to a discord channel via a webhook. Last outlook publish-date is stored in redis to prevent sending duplicate messages of the same outlook.
